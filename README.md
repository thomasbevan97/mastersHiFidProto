## About The Project

This project is the cide for a public disolay that is designed to raise awareness of the decline in bee populations. it uses an arduino for the questionnaire, the raspberry pi to store the infirmarion and a microbit to send the reults to allthe other microbits.



## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Raspberry Pi:
Follow installation instructions and run node on raspberry Pi program

Microbit:
Upload code to relevant Microbit 

Arduino Uno (Grove Base Shield + Grove Dual Buttons):
Upload code to Arduino

* 4 Aditional Microbits required
* 2 Motors
* 14 single colour LEDs
* 2 Neopixels

### Installation



1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thomaspauloehrling/Project-Name.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Enter your API in `config.js`

```sh
npm install serialport
```

## Usage

The code from this project can be used for questionnaires, public displays and 

## Roadmap

Open issues include:
* a lack of solid reliability in communication between central microbit and the surrounding hexagons

Future Features:
* No tethering with wires between arduino  and Raspberry Pi
* Added interactivity with the user such as adding a potentiometer or the ability to spin

## Contributing

This project is not open for contribution as it is a masters degree project limited to the 4 authors listed.
